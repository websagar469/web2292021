2x-5x improvement in your Page Speed score. A completely new way of optimizing your page speed.

== Description ==

[![WP compatibility](https://plugintests.com/plugins/wporg/wp-meteor/wp-badge.svg)](https://plugintests.com/plugins/wporg/wp-meteor/latest) [![PHP compatibility](https://plugintests.com/plugins/wporg/wp-meteor/php-badge.svg)](https://plugintests.com/plugins/wporg/wp-meteor/latest)

WP Meteor is a completely new way of optimizing your page speed. It works even on top of your existing optimizations, including:

* Autoptimize
* WP Rocket
* WP Total Cache
* WP Super Cache
* LiteSpeed Cache

WP Meteor is not compatible with:

* Nitropack

WP Meteor is known to have delay issues with:

* Elementor Offcanvas addon

= WARNING =

The plugin might not work for someone, that's expected - delaying scripts has its downsides. Also, the plugin logics is quite complicated, so bugs happen.

If your site is business-critical or e-commerce, please test carefully all your business-critical pages, forms and/or your checkout process. Feel free to [create an Issue](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wp-meteor/#new-topic-0) if something doesn't work.

The plugin is made to leave no trace on the disk or in the database upon deactivation and removal, so don't hesitate to install and test, may be your site suits well for that kind of optimization.

Don't forget to test the site carefully after plugin installation. If you are not happy with the result - you can either uninstall the plugin, or [create an Issue](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wp-meteor/#new-topic-0), I will either fix the problem, or list a compatibility issue here.

= ONE MORE WARNING =

Infinite delay will delay your GA and GTM until user interaction. I would not recommed to use it, but it is still there because multiple users requested it. Use it with caution and at your own risk. 

= HOW IT WORKS =

If user doesn't start interacting with page immediately, WP Meteor postpones loading and firing scripts until after page gets rendered, giving you **2x-5x** boost in your Pagespeed metric.

This postponement in script loading greatly improves perceived load times for your visitors. It also significantly improves the following **important SEO metrics**:

* [Page Speed](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/)
* [Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)](https://web.dev/lcp/)
* [Time To Interactive (TTI)](https://web.dev/tti/)
* [Total Blocking Time (TBT)](https://web.dev/tbt/)

In May 2021, Google will incorporate [multiple page speed metrics](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2020/11/timing-for-page-experience) as a search signal in the ranking algorythm

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/wp-meteor` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
1. Use the Settings -> WP Meteor screen to configure the plugin


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is it good for SEO? =

Yes, because all that matters is visitor experience, and WP Meteor improves that experience with a lot faster load times

= How can I easily compare speed with/without WP Meteor ? =

Once WP Meteor is enabled, you can add **?wpmeteordisable** query string parameter to a page URL in order to load the page without optimizations

= How to exclude a page from optimization =

Use `wpmeteor_enabled` filter and return false to completely disable WP Meteor, example:

    add_filter('wpmeteor_enabled', function ($value) {
        global $post;
        if ($post && $post->ID == 1) {
            return false;
        }
        return $value;
    });

= How to exclude a script from optimization =

1. Use 'Exclude' tab to exclude scripts by matching src or inline content using regexp
1. Use `wpmeteor_exclude` filter, which accepts 2 arguments: $exclude and $content. $content variable contains either src attribute, or text content of the script tag. Return true if you want to exclude the script. Example:


`    add_filter('wpmeteor_exclude', function ($exclude, $content) {
        if (preg_match('/yourscript\.js/', $content)) {
            return true;
        }
        return $exclude;
    }, null, 2);`


Alternatively, you can use data-wpmeteor-nooptimize="true" script attribute to exclude it from optimization. 


= How to adjust delay outside of 1s, 2s and Infinity =

Use `wpmeteor-frontend-adjust-wpmeteor` filter in the following way:


    add_filter('wp-meteor-frontend-adjust-wpmeteor', function ($wpmeteor, $settings) {
        $wpmeteor['rdelay'] = 4000; // number of milliseconds to delay 
        return $wpmeteor;
    }, 100, 2);
