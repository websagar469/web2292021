== PASSWORDLESS LOGIN ( login without password ) for all two factor methods like google authenticator ==
Passwordless login (Login without password) is a new way of login in which you and your users can login without entering the password. The login can be done by username and 2 factor or only username which can be decided based on the user role. If a role is not allowed for passwordless login they will login with password and username. miniOrange supports many two factor authentication methods for passwordless login. You can use google authenticator, webauthn, fingerprint login, OTP over SMS, and email for login without a password.

= WebAuthn (FIDO2) Passwordless login ( Login without password by using FIDO 2 WebAuthn ) =
WebAuthn is a browser-based API that allows for web applications to simplify and secure user authentication by using registered devices (phones, laptops, etc) as factors. It uses public key cryptography to protect users from advanced phishing attacks. It will allow you to provide your users an option for usernameless login. With the help of webauthn your users can login with fingerprint, FaceID, TouchID, etc.

= Device restriction with webauthn ( FIDO 2 )= 
Webauthn allows you to restrict the number of devices per user. You can allow a user any number of devices they can use to login to your website. Webauthn also covers passwordless and usernameless login in which your users can login from the allowed device without password and username.


= Session restriction and Device restriction using two factor authentication =
Two factor authentication plugin allows you to restrict the number of devices as well as number of active sessions for a particular user. Session restriction and device restriction allows you to stop account sharing with multiple devices as well. Session restriction stops users from logging in or maintaining multiple sessions on the same laptop also, but in case of device restriction you can control the number of devices a user can use for accessing the website. In this way both session restriction and device restriction can help control user access to an account.

== Multi factor authentication ( 2FA / MFA ) ==
You can configure multiple WordPress 2FA methods like google authenticator, OTP over Email, OTP over SMS, etc and choose which method you want to login to your website from a list of configured methods. Multi factor authentication is helpful for cases such as when you do not have your phone and cannot access your TOTP app for login. You can then use other methods like OTP over Email to login.


== login without password with webauthn and two step verification ( 2FA / MFA ) ==
Google authenticator - two step verification along with webauthn allows you to login to your website without using username and password for login. You can login with your device's password or by using any other authentication method like google authenticator, OTP Over SMS, OTP Over Email, etc.


== Prevent Account Sharing Between Users by two factor authentication ( 2FA / MFA ) ==
Many video sharing and E-learning platforms want to prevent sharing of accounts between the users. This can be done using miniOrange Two factor plugin (TFA) with WordPress 2FA methods like QR code Authentication , Mobile Verification, etc. Also, e-learning portals can use this to their advantage. It can be used on any websites which create and sell courses. It can be integrated with plugins like Learndash.
Other sites like premium video content or any premium content where you want users not to share passwords between friends and Family then you can go for this solution. Multiple two factor authentication methods are supported to prevent account sharing.

== [google authenticator - Two step verification] Customize two factor authentication ( Two step verification ) screen as per your website ==

= Why do you need to register for google authenticator? =

Google authenticator uses miniOrange APIs to communicate between your WP and miniOrange. To keep this communication secure, we ask you to register and assign API keys specific to your account. This way your account and users' calls can be only accessed by API keys assigned to you.
Adding to this, you can also use the same account on multiple applications and your users do not have to maintain multiple accounts or WordPress 2FA like Google Authenticator. Single code generated in Google Authenticator will be enough to log in to all sites. With this, you can also achieve sync of two factor authentication on multiple sites. This helps to provide a secure 2fa cloud solution,
